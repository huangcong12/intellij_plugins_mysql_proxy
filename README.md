🙋 Looking for a Maintainer

Hi everyone,

This plugin was my first Java project after graduating from university — it's not perfect, but I created it with passion and a genuine desire to solve real-world problems.

As my time and priorities have shifted, I’m no longer able to actively maintain it. I'm now looking for someone with interest in JetBrains plugin development to take over future improvements and compatibility updates (e.g. supporting new IDEA versions).

If you're:

- Comfortable with Java/Kotlin and Gradle
-   Familiar with IntelliJ plugin development or eager to learn
-   Willing to help improve the code and maintain releases

Then please feel free to reach out!

📫 Contact: huangcong12@gmail.com
(Please mention “JetBrains Plugin Maintainer” in the subject line)

I’d love to see this project continue growing in capable hands. 🙏

# 首次配置
用到了一个从 SQL 语句获取 table 的 jar 包，配置 Gradle 没能下载成功，放到了项目里
